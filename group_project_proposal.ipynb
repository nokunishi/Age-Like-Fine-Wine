    "## Introduction\n",
    "Red wine is not just any beverage. With physiological benefits, red wine can prevent heart disease and contains antioxidants. Although the drunk experience derives from alcohol content, red wine contains sulfur dioxide that may affect the respiratory system but stall oxidation and microbial spoilage and alcohol density that calculates how much alcohol is in a given volume. Inspired by the aforementioned research, we extracted a Wine Quality Data Set for a Portuguese red wine variant, Vinho Verde, the sample for the general red wine. Hence, we aim to answer this question in our classification project: Do alcohol, sulfur dioxide, and density affect the quality of red wine? "

    "## Expected Outcomes and Significance\n",
    "We expect to find that the quality of red wine increases as alcohol content increases but decreases as density and sulfur dioxide increase. If the previous statement is true, this may be applicable for red wine consumers searching for purer and better alcohol with lower intoxicating effects and harmful chemical content. This potential outcome raises a health concern for red wine consumers, leading to the question for winemakers: Is there a way to remove the need to use sulfur dioxide in wine and lower the density? "
